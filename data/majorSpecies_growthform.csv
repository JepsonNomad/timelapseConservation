,"Note these came from Calflora. Some unexpected categorizations: Linanthus pungens is a shrub. When specific growth forms could not be reliably extracted (e.g. due to missing specific epithet), a catch-all VEG was used. Note that Mtn mahogany lumped in with trees since it is the only spp on this list classified as ""Tree, shrub"" on Calflora and inds at my sites are typically above waist height; Eriog wrightii lumped in with shrub since inds at my sites tend to be woody. All ""background"" species, incl. Talus, Decomposing Granite, and Rock, labeled as ROCK"
